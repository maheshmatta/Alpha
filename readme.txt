## A Simplified Client Server Solution for File management by Alpha.

##### Steps to install and use the applications

1. Clone the repo into your system from github using the command 
    `git clone https://github.com/maheshmatta/Alpha`
   or you can use the zip file sent.

2. Run the server_main.py file in one system terminal.
	The server is to be assumed listening for connections on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8080.
	So we dont need to specify the ip and port details. 
Note: The server_functions.py file is a subsidary file of server_main.py, hence need not be seperately executed.

3. Run the clients from different termianls.
